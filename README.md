The company's overall performance is strong, with 73.03bn in total revenue and 786,678 units sold, driven primarily by copier products, which dominate both revenue and unit sales.

The South West region emerges as a major contributor, performing exceptionally in both revenue and units sold, making it a strategic area for continued investment. Similarly, the **top marketsâ€”Ekiti, Abia, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, and Kogiâ€”**play pivotal roles in revenue generation, underscoring the importance of market-specific strategies. However, the underperformance in North Central requires further attention to unlock its potential.

A concerning trend is the decline in unit sales between 2014 and 2015, which signals the need for a deeper investigation into market dynamics and the companyâ€™s sales strategy. Additionally, the businessâ€™s heavy reliance on workday sales presents an opportunity to develop promotional campaigns targeted at holidays and weekends to drive additional revenue.
