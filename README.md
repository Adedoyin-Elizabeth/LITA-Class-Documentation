The results from this project will provide valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and market segmentation, which can help management make informed decisions to maximize revenue and improve operational efficiency.This project involves the analysis of sales data from various regions and markets, focusing on the performance of different product lines and business models. The dataset contains records of transactions across multiple stores within Nigeriaâ€™s Federal Capital Territory, offering insights into product performance, revenue generation, and customer behavior.```

## Objectives:
The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to uncover trends, identify challenges, and provide actionable recommendations for business growth. Below are the key objectives:
1. Regional and Market Performance: Analyse the region and markets that generate the highest and lowest revenue, the underperforming regions that need attention

2. Product Line Performance: Determine the product categories (e.g., service plans, parts) that generate the most revenue and units sold, the certain products that are more popular in specific markets or regions

3. Customer Purchase Behavior:Identify different transaction categories (low, medium, high) impact revenue, customers purchasing higher quantities on specific days (e.g., weekends vs. workdays)

4.Temporal Analysis: Identify how sales trends vary across fiscal periods, the seasonal patterns that impact revenue generation or sales volume
5.Data Quality Issues and Improvements: Clean and manage missing or redundant data to improve the quality of insights, Generate new features if necessary (e.g., average revenue per transaction).
